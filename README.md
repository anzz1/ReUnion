Metamod plugin that allows protocol 47 and 48 non-steam clients to connect to ReHLDS servers.<br/>
Reunion is a continuation of the DProto project adapted for ReHLDS.<br/>

You can try playing on one of many servers that are using Reunion: [Game Tracker](http://www.gametracker.com/search/?search_by=server_variable&search_by2=reu_version)

## Downloads
* [Release builds](https://github.com/rehlds/ReUnion/releases)
* [Dev builds](https://github.com/rehlds/ReUnion/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Environment requirement
* ReHLDS API >= `3.10`

## Installation

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Go to `<gamedir>/addons/` and make new directory named `reunion`<br/>
`<gamedir>` - its a game directory (cstrike for Counter-Strike, valve for Half-Life, etc)

2. Copy `reunion_mm.dll` or `reunion_mm_i386.so` to `<gamedir>/addons/reunion/`

3. Go to metamod installation directory (usually its `<gamedir>/addons/metamod/`) and edit `plugins.ini`:<br/>
add this line at the beginning of the file<br/>
for windows<br/>
`win32 addons\reunion\reunion_mm.dll`<br/>
for linux<br/>
`linux addons/reunion/reunion_mm_i386.so`<br/>

4. Copy `reunion.cfg` to server root or gamedir.

5. Start the server. When server loads, type `meta list` in console. You'll see something like this:
```
        Currently loaded plugins:
              description      stat pend  file              vers      src   load  unlod
         [ 1] Reunion          RUN   -    reunion_mm_i386.  v0.1.58   ini   Start Never
         [ 2] AMX Mod X        RUN   -    amxmodx_mm_i386.  v1.8.1.3  ini   Start ANY
        2 plugins, 2 running
```
6. Ready to use

If reunion doesn't work, meta list says this:<br/>
```
Currently loaded plugins:
      description      stat pend  file              vers      src   load  unlod
 [ 1] Reunion          fail load  reunion_mm_i386.  v0.1.65   ini   Start Never
```
Start server with `-console +log on +mp_logecho 1` parameters and look through console output.<br/>
You'll find the reason there.

## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

* `Q` I configured `SteamIdHashSalt` as well as in the dproto, but players get a different steamids. Why?<br/>
  `A` Reunion uses an another hashing algorythm with improved security. Knowing of someones's steamid before enabling `SteamIdHashSalt` doesn't help to get same id after hashing.

* `Q` Is it possible to do something against steamid changers?<br/>
  `A` No, idchangers generates a correct authorization tickets and it's impossible on serverside identify that steamid was changed. You can only set a `SteamIdHashSalt` option to prevent a substitution to specific steamid of another player.

* `Q` Why some server monitorings can't receive the players list from server?<br/>
  `A` They use an incorrect query format and must be rewritten using latest <a href="https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query">PHP-Source-Query</a> script or equivalent.

* `Q` In dproto was option Game_Name, but in reunion it has not. How to change the game name?<br/>
  `A` Use plugin.

* `Q` Why has `SmartSteamEmu3` support been removed?<br/>
  `A` To open-source the Reunion project, we had to remove some sensitive components.<br/>
   This includes the `SmartSteamEmu3` emulator's authorization code.
   Removing it won't significantly affect server online activity since this emulator is rare among non-steam clients.
